# Logic Gate

JavaScript app to create and edit logic gate circuits

I've already made a logic gate editor before, but it was quite heavy-weight and restricted

## Key differences

- Components can be placed anywhere (not restricted to grid)
- Component evaluation is evaluated in-order (not randomly)
- Aim to be mostly pure JavaScript

## Libraries

Stored under `src/lib/*`

- `p5.js` P5.js is a library that assists with canvas graphics. View more at [https://p5js.org/](https://p5js.org/).
- `sound.js` A quick sound library which I made in another project.
